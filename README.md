# Demo app showcasing SOLID principles

In this demo app I explore how SOLID principles can solve an issue of multiple teams working on same feature possibly creating merge conflict.

The demo app exhibits a `RegistrationViewController` which is supposed to perform a user registration action. On `registerButtonTouched()` IBAction it performs local email validation and sends API request to register new user.

## Common implementation approach, not using SOLID

The typical implementation of the registration button logic can be seen in branch [no-solid](https://github.com/ibru/composition-demo/tree/no-solid) in [func RegistrationViewController.registerButtonTouched()](https://github.com/ibru/composition-demo/blob/8e60fdd46837e1485bb62c2d1e013832890cb80e/CompositionDemo/Modules/Sources/LoginFeature/Sources/RegistrationViewController.swift#L63)
It makes the `RegistrationViewController` be directly dependent on [EmailValidator](https://github.com/ibru/composition-demo/blob/no-solid/CompositionDemo/Modules/Sources/Core/Sources/EmailValidator.swift) and [RegistrationAPI](https://github.com/ibru/composition-demo/blob/no-solid/CompositionDemo/Modules/Sources/Networking/Sources/RegistrationAPI.swift) classes which are stored in different modules.

Then I showcase 4 different pull request which are attempting 4 different codebase improvements.

1. [Refactoring of RegistrationViewController](https://github.com/ibru/composition-demo/pull/4/files)
2. [Enhance local email validation](https://github.com/ibru/composition-demo/pull/1/files)
3. [Migrate RegistrationAPI public interface to use async/await](https://github.com/ibru/composition-demo/pull/3/files)
4. [Adding new functionality of checking for email domain](https://github.com/ibru/composition-demo/pull/5/files)

These improvements, even though they essentially happen inside different modules, all end up modifying same place - the method `RegistrationViewController.registerButtonTouched()`. And creating merge conflicts.

More over these improvements result in making `LoginModule` being dependent on even more external modules (adding dependency to `Security`) module which might lead to spaghetti dependencies, slow build times, harder reasoning about code.

## Improved implementation following SOLID

Then, [I refactor the `RegistrationViewController`](https://github.com/ibru/composition-demo/pull/2) logic to follow SOLID principles and redo the same PRs again.


1. [Refactoring of RegistrationViewController](https://github.com/ibru/composition-demo/pull/7/files)
2. [Enhance local email validation](https://github.com/ibru/composition-demo/pull/9/files)
3. [Migrate RegistrationAPI public interface to use async/await](https://github.com/ibru/composition-demo/pull/8/files)
4. [Adding new functionality of checking for email domain](https://github.com/ibru/composition-demo/pull/6/files)

Now the PRs doing same changes as before end up modifying different places in the codebase and do not create any merge conflict.
More over they tend to get simpler and more isolated, resulting in greater control over source code changes, predictability of development and less chances of unintentionally breaking unrelated part of the app.

## SOLID principles applied in the codebase


### S-ingle-responsibility principle
"There should never be more than one reason for a class to change."

- the `RegistrationViewController` depending only on `RegistrationService`
- Registration adapters adapting interfaces one one class into interfaces needed for other class

### O-penâ€“closed principle
"Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

- modifying existing/adding new functionality by appending new service inside `RegistrationFactory`

### L-iskov substitution principle
"Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it."

- Using `AppendingRegistrationService`, `FallbackRegistrationService` and composing multiple `RegistrationService` implementation into a place where `RegistrationService` instance is expected

### I-nterface segregation principle
"Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."

- not being used in this example

### D-ependency inversion principle
"Depend upon abstractions, not concretions".

- making `RegistrationViewController` depend on abstraction - the protocol `RegistrationService`, instead of concrete implementations of `EmailValidator`, `RegistrationAPI` etc.
